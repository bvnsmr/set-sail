# set-sail
A tool for quickly bootstrapping Tailwind CSS projects with different frameworks.

Supported frameworks:
 - React (using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app))

[View the tailwind docs here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)

## Get Started

```
npx set-sail
? App Name: my-app
? Which framework would you like to use?

cd my-app
yarn start
```
This will create a directory `my-app` in the current folder and generate a project based on the framework you have chosen. It will then add the necessary tailwind css configs and dependencies.

To get the most out of tailwind and its powerful features take a look at the [offical docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).

## Note 
I'm not affiliated with [tailwindlabs](https://github.com/tailwindlabs) in any way, just made this tool for myself and thought others may find it useful - though it probably already exists somewhere.
